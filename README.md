# Twilio Voice AI Assistant with OpenAI Realtime API

A real-time voice AI assistant built with Twilio Voice and OpenAI's Realtime API. This project creates an interactive voice experience where users can have natural conversations with an AI assistant over the phone.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Powered by OpenAI's Realtime API
- üìû **Phone Integration**: Uses Twilio Voice for telephony
- ü§ñ **Personality-driven AI**: Bubbly assistant with dad jokes and owl jokes
- üîÑ **Low-latency Audio**: Optimized for natural conversation flow
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modern Node.js**: Built with Fastify and ES6 modules

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Twilio account with Voice-enabled phone number
- OpenAI account with Realtime API access
- ngrok for local development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd "Twillio OpenAI Realtime"
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=5050
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

2. In another terminal, start ngrok:
```bash
ngrok http 5050
```

3. Update your Twilio webhook URL to:
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/incoming-call
```

4. Call your Twilio phone number to test!

## Architecture

The application acts as a proxy between Twilio's Media Streams and OpenAI's Realtime API:

- **Twilio** handles the phone call and audio streaming
- **WebSocket Proxy** bridges Twilio and OpenAI audio data
- **OpenAI Realtime API** processes speech and generates responses
- **Audio Format Conversion** ensures compatibility (G.711 Œº-law)

## Configuration

### AI Personality

Customize the AI assistant's personality by modifying the `SYSTEM_MESSAGE` in `index.js`:

```javascript
const SYSTEM_MESSAGE = 'Your custom personality prompt here...';
```

### Voice Settings

Adjust the voice and temperature:

```javascript
const VOICE = 'alloy'; // OpenAI voice options
const TEMPERATURE = 0.8; // Response randomness (0-1)
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /incoming-call` - Twilio webhook for incoming calls
- `WebSocket /media-stream` - Real-time audio streaming

## Troubleshooting

- **"Application error occurred"**: Check that your Twilio webhook URL matches your current ngrok URL
- **No audio**: Verify your OpenAI API key and Realtime API access
- **Connection issues**: Ensure ngrok is running and accessible

## Based On

This project is based on the [Twilio blog tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/voice-ai-assistant-openai-realtime-api-node) for building voice AI assistants.
